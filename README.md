# Aurora (Back-End)

Aurora is the ultimate productivity app for procastinators. It allows users to set a daily target, and they have to hit a minimum of the daily target for the day to be a success.

This is Aurora's backend server, open to power users who want to request the API instead of run it in the mobile app.

Uncover how to authenticate your session, access daily tasks, and return other details.

Welcome, Sailor!
